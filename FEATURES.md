Since the bot contains 3 distinct parts (Discord, Twitch chat, website), the lists below are split into these same parts (with a 'Main' section too).

Should we move this into the Github 'Projects' section?

# Main
- [ ] Finish filling out `FEATURES.md`
- [ ] Connect to MongoDB

# Twitch Chat
- [ ] Connect to twitch chat
- [ ] Ensure that the bot can't go over its chat rate limit
- [ ] Primitive spam filter
- [ ] Passive buck gain, 1 gained per every 10 minutes
- [ ] Blacklist for bucks (to prevent farming)
- [ ] Keep a log of buck donations
- [ ] Implement `!voteskip` command

# Discord
- [ ] Connect to discord chat
- [ ] Ping `@everyone` when stream goes live
- [ ] Allow users to access baboon buck info

# Website
- [ ] Display full buck leaderboard using [this](https://datatables.net/)
