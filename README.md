# GiruBot (v2)

This repository contains the code for the Discord, Twitch chat and [website](http://vkclan.eu) portions of GiruBot.

The bot uses Node.js and MongoDB, so you'll need both of those to run the bot. You'll also need to fill out the correct details for the bot in the `secrets.js` file.

To run the bot (OSX, Unix only):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/64/girubot
cd girubot
npm install # You can safely ignore the warnings about missing packages
npm start
```
